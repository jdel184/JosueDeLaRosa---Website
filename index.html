        <p class="lead mb-4">My Name Is Josue Delarosa and I love to create. I am a very creative person and will create as much as I love to. film is a great and convenient way for me to create without anything holding me back. Film is a way for me to do m best work and to continue doing my best work while enjoying life. it is important to enjoy what you love to do in life, which is why i chose film. I love to create and to gain more skill as i continue to improve. Gaining skill in what i love to do just makes working more interesting and enjoyable. To be able to create with your imagination is a gift, and many people can do it. Creating comes from a state of mind where you are able to be free. Being free is essential in order for you to overcome adversity. <br><br>

        Underdog, a term for those with little chance of success;, a term for those who are weaker;, a term for those who are black sheep to live by. I was never the athletic boy with outstanding looks able to snatch up any girl in his path, nor was I the popular kid who was known by the entire school and—, and as I soon found out in high school—, I was not the intelligent child whose’s silence could only be broken if spoken to. To constantly, and frantically, search for answers had been the making of my freshman and sophomore years, but the question still lingered over my soul:, “Who am I?” The time to finally obtain my first clue was upon me, Junior year.Toward the end of my Sophomore year I signed up for my first AP class, Mr. Coogan’s English Language and Composition class, and I was determined to take it despite the scare tactics he would use to weed out students. Finally, the time for me to walk through his door as a determined student had come.; However, I would soon feel my confidence sink to my stomach the moment I stepped through the door, though. As I entered the room all I could see were stares from people who thought I did not belong, and the feeling was extremely hostile. They did not say a word—, they did not need to—, their eyes said everything. They interrogated, asking me, “W why are you even here?.” For that, I did not have an answer. I quickly walked to my seat as they continued to pierce through me with their glares. 
<br><br>

        In the end i received an award,As I received the award, the whole class could see the answer to their question right in front of them as the biggest smile engulfed my face. 
Receiving that award did not make me an expert in writing, for I had much to learn, but it made me an expert in an even greater field: being an underdog., the underdog field.  I was an underdog my whole life, but I never realized until Junior year just how much. I always wanted to fit in but never could, because fitting in was not me;, it was not who I was. While bBeing different was not the entirety of who I was, it was definitely a step towards the right path. Being an underdog meant I was different, it meant I was strong, it meant I could do things my way and succeed in life. Obtaining that award meant passing my most difficult task as an underdog, which made me an expert. I started from the very bottom and when I reached the top, receiving my award, the class again asked, “why are you even here” and with a smile I simply answered, “ to enjoy myself, to have fun.”  This is what freedom is, the freedom to create... maybe.
